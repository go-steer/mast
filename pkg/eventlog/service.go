// service is the session.Service eventlog.Open returns. It wraps
// ADK's database.SessionService unchanged for Get/List and
// serializes all writes (Create / Delete / AppendEvent) behind a
// single write mutex so concurrent writers — typically a parent
// agent and its background subagents sharing the same eventlog —
// never race at the SQLite layer.
//
// Why the mutex (and not just SQLite's busy_timeout): SQLite's WAL
// mode allows concurrent readers + one writer, but if a second writer
// arrives mid-write the SQLite busy-wait is on a per-connection
// timer, and gorm opens its own internal connection pool for ADK
// that we can't tune. Serializing at the Go layer is durable across
// driver / dialector choices and makes the consistency model
// trivially obvious: writes happen in the order they're invoked.
//
// Reads (Get/List) intentionally do NOT take the mutex — SQLite WAL
// handles concurrent readers natively and serializing reads would
// defeat the purpose of having an eventlog for live-tail observers.
//
// Consistency model for AppendEvent: the ADK events row and the
// overlay row that carries the event's monotonic seq are written in
// one transaction (#450) — the overlay insert runs inside ADK's own
// event transaction, so the two commit together or not at all and an
// overlay write that fails rolls the event back with it. See
// atomic.go for how, and for the two paths that still write after ADK
// rather than inside it. The overlay table's unique index on event_id
// keeps a caller's retry a no-op rather than a duplicate.

// running inside ADK's own transaction, so a crash between the writes
// can no longer leave an event that the overlay — the index every
// Since and Watch consumer reads — does not have. See atomic.go.
//
// Two paths still write after ADK rather than inside it, and both are

// is exactly the behaviour that shipped before this: not atomic, but
// no worse than it was. And when ADK writes nothing at all, neither do
