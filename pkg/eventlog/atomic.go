// One event, one transaction (#450).
//
// AppendEvent used to be two independent writes: ADK persisted its
// events row and then we inserted the overlay row that gives the event
// its monotonic seq. A crash, OOM kill or node eviction landing between
// them left an event that ADK has and the overlay does not — and the
// overlay is the index every eventlog consumer reads. Since and Watch
// query overlay rows and hydrate from ADK afterwards, so an event with
// no row is not late: it is permanently absent from live tail, attach
// replay and every transcript built on them, while sitting intact in
// the database the whole time.
//
// mast hangs more off that index than the shared text suggests. The
// seq every attach subscriber walks, the durable spend ledger, the
// bounded read behind GET /healthz and the park rows all key on it, so
// an event with no companion row is, concretely, a durable park nothing
// can see. The window is milliseconds and the workload is an unattended
// daemon running for hours on a cluster that evicts pods, which is
// precisely the case --session-db exists to survive.
//
// "Callers can retry" — the old comment's answer — is true, and there
// is no caller that does.
//
// The two writes could not simply be wrapped, because they are on two
// different connection pools: Open runs ADK's databaseService against
// its own gorm.DB and opens a second one for the overlay against the
// same DSN. Two SQLite connections cannot share a transaction, so an
// outer db.Transaction would merely nest a second connection's
// transaction inside ADK's and commit them separately — the same bug
// with more syntax.
//
// So we do not try to join ADK's transaction from outside — we get
// invited in. ADK's applyEvent runs `s.db.WithContext(ctx).Transaction`,
// and inside it `tx.Create(storageEv)`. GORM runs registered create
// callbacks on that same `tx`, so a callback registered on ADK's
// *gorm.DB fires with the transaction in hand. The overlay row is
// inserted there, on ADK's connection, inside ADK's transaction: the
// two rows now commit together or not at all, and an error from the
// overlay insert aborts the event write rather than orphaning it.
//
// Three things make this less clever than it sounds:
//
//   - The only ADK internal it depends on is the table name "events".
//     Everything else the row needs travels down from AppendEvent
//     through the context, because ADK passes the caller's ctx into
//     Transaction and GORM hangs it on tx.Statement.Context. No
//     reflection over ADK's row struct, no assumption about its
//     columns.
//   - It degrades rather than fails. Open reaches ADK's *gorm.DB with
//     the same adkGormDB helper Close already uses to shut its pool
//     down; if a future ADK changes shape, registration is skipped and
//     AppendEvent falls back to the two-write path it has always used.
//     A missing atomicity guarantee is the old behaviour, and the old
//     behaviour is not a crash. A test fails loudly if that fallback
//     engages on the ADK mast ships, because nothing else would say so.
//   - It cannot recurse. The callback fires for every create on ADK's
//     pool, including its own overlay insert; the table filter stops
//     the second pass, and the pending record is consumed once.
//
// Not in scope here: overlay rows orphaned by a crash *before* this
// change. Backfilling them at Open would hand each a fresh seq at the
// end of the log, so a replay would deliver a pre-crash event after
// every event written since — ordering damage in exchange for presence,
// on rows nobody can distinguish from a session ADK pruned. The fix
// stops new orphans; existing ones stay invisible, which is what they
// already are.
