//   - Typed form (Type != ""): carries a protocol event type and
//     a payload that gets marshaled directly. The writer emits this
//     as `event: <Type>` with JSON(TypedData) as the data block.
//     Used for every event defined in the SSE event-stream
//     protocol spec (capabilities, status-update, usage-update,
//     inbox, turn-complete, turn-error).
