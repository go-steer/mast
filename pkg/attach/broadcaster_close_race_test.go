// TestBroadcaster_SubscribeRacingClose pins the #483 fix. Handlers
// resolve a broadcaster via pool.For BEFORE subscribing, and DELETE
// /sessions runs pool.Retire (remove + Close) in between — so Subscribe can
// execute against an already-closed broadcaster. Pre-fix that was
// `panic: assignment to entry in nil map` inside Subscribe while it
// held b.mu with no deferred unlock: net/http recovered the panic and
// the mutex stayed locked forever, wedging every later operation on
// the broadcaster. The near-miss interleaving (registration wins by a
// hair) spawned goroutines after Close's wg.Wait had returned — the
// exact use-after-close on the eventlog that #424 fenced.
//
// Post-fix: Subscribe checks a closed flag under b.mu (deferred
// unlock) and returns an already-closed channel; both wg.Adds happen
// inside the same critical section so Close's wg.Wait can't miss a
// racing joiner. 200 iterations under -race in CI.
