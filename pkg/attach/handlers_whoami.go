// GET /whoami — resolved caller identity for the current request.
// Session-agnostic; the standard middleware runs so a listener that
// requires a bearer token still 401s an unauthenticated caller
// exactly like every other route. When the middleware allows through
// (anonymous or authenticated), the handler returns whatever the
// resolver stamped onto the context.
//
// Companion to the v1.4.0 `capabilities.caller_id` display hint
// (see events.go + capabilities.go): the SSE stream advertises the
// identity as a fast path so clients don't need a second fetch, but
// this endpoint is the canonical source and carries the admin flag +
// auth-source discriminator too.

// whoAmIResponse is the response shape of GET /whoami. Source is a
// coarse discriminator so client-side auth-debug flows can show
// "authenticated via bearer" vs "impersonating via asserted-caller"
// without needing to inspect the request headers themselves.
//
// Source only ever reports a value the SERVER verified or was
// explicitly configured to trust (#385): the caller-resolution
// middleware stamps its verdict onto the request context and the
// handler echoes it. It is never re-derived from raw request headers
// — an Authorization header the server didn't validate, or a
// gateway-style X-Goog-* header any client can forge, does not
// change Source.
//
// Consumers MUST tolerate unknown Source values — a future
// authenticator (K8s SA, OIDC/JWT) will add its own tag.
