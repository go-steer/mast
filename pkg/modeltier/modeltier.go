// Package modeltier classifies LLM model IDs into capability tiers
// (frontier / mid / small) used to tune behavior whose right setting
// depends on how powerfully the model reasons.
//
// First consumer: the compactor (pkg/agent). A single
// utilization-threshold (0.85) is fine for frontier models — they
// reason coherently with 850k tokens of context. Small models
// degrade much earlier (Flash gets unreliable somewhere in the
// 200-300k range on a 1M window), so the compaction trigger needs
// to fire well before 85% to keep the session functional.
//
// Future consumers: anything that wants a tier label (per-tier
// budget caps, per-tier loop-detection sensitivity, per-tier UI
// hints in `/stats`). Add lookups here so the model→tier table
// stays in one place.
//
// Classification is by substring match against the model ID.
// Unknown models classify as "" — callers should treat the empty
// string as "skip the tier-specific behavior" rather than guess.
//
// Maintenance: when a new model ships, add it to one of the case
// branches in Classify. Substring patterns let the lookup land
// regardless of date suffix (`-20251001`, `@20251101`, etc.).
// This table moves with two others: pkg/pricing's builtin and
// pkg/taskclass's ModelForTier. The first of those is generated
// weekly from a RULE, not a hand-kept list, so a model can arrive
// here without anyone deciding to add it — pkg/pricing's
// TestBuiltinModelsKnownToCompanionTables fails the build when a
// newly-priced model has no case here, which is the only thing that
// makes this file's maintenance visible rather than overdue.

// the design doc's best-guess defaults for v2.5. Tune from
// telemetry once we have it. Frontier stays at 0.85 to match the
// historical universal default so existing operators on frontier

//
// The classifier is intentionally hand-maintained rather than
