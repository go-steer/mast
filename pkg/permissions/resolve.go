// against — checking the lexical path while the OS follows symlinks
// would let an in-scope symlink alias an out-of-scope target (#374).
//
// Paths that don't exist yet (new-file writes) are handled by
// resolving the deepest existing ancestor directory and rejoining the
// non-existing remainder, so `write_file` into a fresh subdirectory
// still classifies against the directory's real location.
//
// Any resolution error other than "does not exist" (permission
// denied on an ancestor, symlink loops, ...) is returned to the
// caller, which is expected to fail closed — treat the path as
// out-of-scope rather than fall back to the lexical form.
