// The file holds bearer secrets, so the default remains 0600. The one
// relaxation is group-read, and only when this process is already a
// member of the owning group — which is not a laxity so much as a
// recognition that Kubernetes leaves no other option. `fsGroup` is the
// standard way to give a non-root pod read access to a Secret volume,
// and it unconditionally sets group-read on every file in that volume.
// A blanket `mode&0o077 != 0` rejection is therefore in direct conflict
// with the platform: mounting users.json from a Secret fails by
// construction, and mast's own StatefulSet sets an fsGroup
// (deploy/base/50-statefulset-daemon.yaml), so the recipe anyone starts
// from arms the trigger.
//
// The equality is the entire security argument, so it is worth stating
// plainly. Group-read widens access to members of the owning group and
// to nobody else. When this process is one of those members, the bit
// grants no read that the reader did not already hold — it is a
// permission the daemon has by other means anyway. When it is not, the
// bit hands the credential to someone else, and that is still rejected,
// now with the gid named so the mismatch is diagnosable rather than a
// bare mode dump.
//
// Everything else stays strict, including the bits that might look
// harmless next to group-read:
//
//   - Any other-bit is rejected. "Other" is unbounded by definition.
//   - Group-write and group-execute are rejected. Neither is needed to
//     read a credential, and group-write means a co-member can swap
//     the daemon's entire user table.
//
// gid is the file's owning group, or unknownGID where the platform
// cannot report one. memberOf reports whether this process belongs to
// a given gid. Both are parameters so the cases that cannot be staged
// with chown — a foreign gid, an unreportable one — are still tested.
