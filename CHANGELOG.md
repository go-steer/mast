# Changelog

## Unreleased (Phase 1, toward v0.1.0)

- **P1.1 bootstrap (2026-07-26).** The repo grows code: the spike-validated
  prototype graduates from the standalone `mast-prototype` repo
  (tags `spike1`/`spike2`; verified findings in
  [`docs/spike-findings.md`](./docs/spike-findings.md)) — workload-bundle +
  specialists loaders, workflow-graph and SubAgents dispatch shapes, durable
  HITL on ADK's SQLite session service, budget metering, per-specialist MCP
  tool allowlists, GKE MCP wiring, inject/resume HTTP endpoints, and the GKE
  triage example workload. Pinned to `google.golang.org/adk/v2 v2.1.0`.
  Provenance per [`docs/fork-design.md`](./docs/fork-design.md): attribution
  is by reference, not git history — prototype history remains in
  `mast-prototype`.
