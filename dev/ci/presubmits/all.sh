# all.sh — run every presubmit in order, with a PASS/FAIL line per
# step and a summary at the end. Exits non-zero if any step failed
# (all steps run regardless, so one run shows every failure).
#
# CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs these same scripts, split across
# parallel jobs for wall-clock and per-check granularity; this runner
# is the sequential local equivalent, so a local all.sh pass means
# every CI check passes (house rule #6: don't ship preventable red
# builds). Adding a step means wiring it here AND into a ci.yml job.
