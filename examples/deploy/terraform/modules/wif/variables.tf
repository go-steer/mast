    Kubernetes namespace the daemon runs in. This is part of the identity,

    Where mast's authority to CHANGE a cluster comes from.

    "namespaced" (default) binds roles/container.viewer and leaves writes to
    the Kubernetes RBAC the chart renders — the boundary an operator can see
    and audit per namespace.

    "cluster-admin" binds roles/container.admin instead. GKE allows an API
    call if EITHER IAM or RBAC allows it, and the daemon reaches the cluster
    through the GKE MCP server as this principal, so while that binding
    stands the chart's namespaced write Roles subtract nothing. Use it to
    unblock an incident, then come back.
