    The RBAC username the GKE API server gives this principal — a User, not

    names only the ServiceAccount matches nothing on the MCP path, so every
    call is Forbidden including reads. The chart binds both subjects; this
    output is what to grep for in `kubectl get rolebinding -o yaml` when
    checking that it did.

    The project roles this module currently holds bound, read off the

    roles/container.admin is absent from this list because the binding is
    gone, not because a variable changed.
