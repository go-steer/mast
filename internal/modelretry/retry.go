// Package modelretry waits out a provider that says "not now".
//
// # Why this exists (#239, then #452)
//
// It was written for the judge eval tier. That tier's expensive failure
// is not a low score — a low score reports and does not gate — it is a
// row that never ran, which makes the board incomplete and the night
// red. On 2026-08-21 three of thirty-one rows were lost to
// `Error 429 ... RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` from Vertex, and the tier made no
// attempt to get them back, so a provider-side quota blip presented as
// a broken measurement of mast.
//
// The asymmetry that hid this is worth stating, because it is invisible
// from mast's side of the interface: anthropic-sdk-go retries 429s and
// 5xxs twice of its own accord, and google.golang.org/genai returns
// APIError{Code: 429} straight out of api_client.go with no retry at
// all. So the same corpus, on the same night, was measuring two
// different amounts of resilience depending on which model it named.
// Retrying at model.LLM — the one interface both providers arrive
// through — is what makes the two boards comparable.
//
// # The promotion (#452)
//
// For eight releases this lived in internal/evals/judge and wrapped
// nothing but the eval harness's own models. That is the inversion
// #452 named: mast's *measurement* of mast was resilient to a 429 and
// the product was not. The measurement is mast's own and it is dated —
// three rows in thirty-one, through compose.BuildModel, against real
// Vertex — so the issue's "only if the evals say yes" gate was already
// answered by mast's own artifact and did not need a second study.
//
// What moved is the mechanism. What did not move is the judge tier's
// reasoning about its own numbers: a nightly with a 90-minute budget
// and thirty-one sequential metered rows wants four attempts over half
// a minute, and an unattended turn does not. The two policies are
// [ProductionConfig] and [JudgeConfig], side by side, so the divergence
// is a diff rather than a rediscovery.
//
// This does not soften anything. An incomplete board still fails and a
// dispatch that ends short still reports short; the point is to stop
// paying for a provider blip with a result.

//
// Every number differs from [JudgeConfig], and each difference is the

//
// **One attempt, not four.** The evidence for a retry at all is that the
// next call a few seconds later succeeds; four attempts over half a
// minute is not more of that argument, it is a different bet. The judge
// tier takes it because a lost row costs a whole night and the tier is
// already measured in tens of minutes. An unattended turn is not: a
// workload on a fifteen-minute cadence can absorb two seconds and
// should not absorb thirty-nine, because a turn that waits that long
// has stopped being late and started being wedged.
//
// **A cooldown, which the judge has none of.** The judge runs its rows
// one at a time, so "retry under pressure adds load" bounded itself.
// mast dispatches in parallel: a fan-out of eight specialists that all
// meet the same shed would, with no cooldown, answer it with eight
// retries two seconds later — precisely the objection. One retry per
// minute per process is the answer, and it is process-wide rather than
// per-model for the same reason: a specialist's `model:` override
// builds its own model.LLM, so per-instance state would give a roster
// of eight one cooldown each and no cooldown at all.
//
// **Still no jitter.** The judge declined it because there was one
// serial caller and nothing to desynchronize. Under the cooldown there
// is at most one retry in flight per window, which is the same
// conclusion by the stronger route: jitter spreads a thundering herd,
