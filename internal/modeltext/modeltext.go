// Package modeltext reads the caller-facing text out of a model response
// part (#370).
//
// It exists because "the model's answer" and "the text parts of the model's
// content" are not the same set, and the difference is a thinking block. A
// provider that reasons returns its reasoning as a text part flagged
// Thought, and that part is there for the provider's own replay — Anthropic
// requires the assistant turn preceding a tool_result to carry its thinking
// blocks back with their signatures intact — not for a caller to read.
//
// Before this package the distinction was made in exactly one place
// (pkg/agent's stall detector) and omitted in eight others, including the
// A2A result artifact handed to another team's agent, the AG-UI
// TextMessage stream, and the eval trace whose FinalText the graders read.
// Nothing leaked, because claude-opus-5 under the request mast sends today
// returns a thinking block with a signature and an EMPTY body. That is a
// property of the vendor's default and not of this repo: the same model
// asked with `{"type":"adaptive","display":"summarized"}` returns the
// reasoning text populated. So the eight omissions were one vendor default
// away from being a disclosure, and a predicate everyone calls is worth
// more than eight comments nobody has to read.
//
// Reasoning is not permanently unreachable. docs/ag-ui-design.md OQ 5 is
// resolved (#98, 2026-09-16) as an opt-in per bundle, agui.emit_reasoning,
// and it is built the way this package's existence implies: the AG-UI
// emitter reads Thought parts through Thought below, deliberately and by
// name. Nothing in this repo publishes reasoning by not filtering it.

// Text reports the caller-facing text carried by one part of a model's

//
// ok is false for three things: a nil part, a part with no text at all
// (a function call or response), and a thinking block — including a
// redacted one, whose payload rides in ThoughtSignature with no text to
// return. Callers should branch on ok rather than on the emptiness of the
// returned string, so that "the model said nothing" and "the model thought
// something I must not repeat" stay distinguishable at the call site.

// Thought reports the reasoning text carried by one part of a model's
// content, and whether there is any. It is Text's deliberate counterpart:
// the AG-UI emitter's agui.emit_reasoning opt-in (#98, ag-ui-design.md OQ 5)
// publishes reasoning by CALLING THIS, not by declining to call Text. A
// publication surface should have to name what it publishes, so that
// "reasoning reached a browser" is a grep for one symbol rather than an
// audit of every place a part's Text field is read.
//
// ok is false for a nil part, a part that is not a thinking block, and a
// thinking block that carries no prose — which today is the common case:
// claude-opus-5 under the request mast sends returns a thinking block whose
// body is empty and whose payload rides in ThoughtSignature. That signature
// is never returned here and has no AG-UI frame. It is a provider replay
// credential — Anthropic requires it back, verbatim and intact, on the
// assistant turn preceding a tool_result — and handing it to a browser
// publishes a token rather than a thought.
//
// Text and Thought are disjoint: no part satisfies both, so a caller that
// wants everything the model emitted must call both, and a caller that
// calls neither publishes nothing.
