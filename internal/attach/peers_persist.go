// Cross-restart durability for the hub's peer registry (#180).
//
// Without it, a hub restart drops every registration and each peer
// stays invisible until its next heartbeat fails and it re-registers
// — a 20-60s blackout during which "who's in the fleet?" answers
// wrong rather than answering slowly. Peers recover on their own, so
// this is an availability optimization, not a correctness one. It
// matters more here than it does upstream for the reason mast exists:
// upstream's operator is at a terminal and closes the loop in
// minutes, and mast's premise is that nobody is watching, so the
// blackout lasts until whatever schedule would have used a peer fires
// and finds none.
//
// The record below is deliberately NOT the Peer struct. Peer's JSON
// tags are the *wire* shape, and they redact: Owner is `json:"-"`
// because it's hub-side authorization state that discovery responses
// must not leak. Persisting Peer directly would therefore reload
// every registration as ownerless, which silently undoes the #384
// hardening — canManage collapses to `c.Admin || c.Identity == ""`,
// so in single-user mode (empty caller identity) every caller would
// see and be able to delete every peer's registration ID, and in
// multi-session mode the real owner would lose access to its own.
// A file format and a wire format want different things; they get
// different structs.
//
// Replaying the owner is the safe direction of that decision and not
// only the faithful one: an owner is a restriction, so carrying it
// across a restart can only narrow who may manage the registration.
// The lease is the opposite kind of state, and gets the opposite
// treatment — see loadPeerState.

// grant — it says "this peer counts as live until T without saying
// anything further" — and a hub restarted with WithMaxTTL lowered
// from five minutes to thirty seconds would otherwise honor the old
// grant twice over. Once because the reloaded expiry is still five
// minutes out, and then forever, because Heartbeat re-derives the TTL
// from LeaseExpiresAt-LastHeartbeat and would keep renewing at the
// ceiling the operator just removed. Clamping on the way in makes the
// running config the only thing that decides how long a peer may be
// unresponsive and still be reported as part of the fleet.
//
// The narrowing direction needs no such care and gets none: an owner
// is replayed as written, because carrying a restriction forward can
