// MetricReach reports how much of the corpus one metric can actually
// score — the guard against a metric that is green because it never ran.
//
// Upstream's harness is the cautionary case, twice over: its
// tool_coverage reads a key no scenario carries and returns 1.0 on all
// 31 rows, and its severity_accuracy extracts a bracketed token the
// corpus never writes and returns 0 on all 31. Both are constant
// functions, and nothing in either output says so. Result.Vacuous marks
// the individual case; this is the corpus-wide roll-up that turns it
// into a harness failure instead of a green board.
//
// Reach is necessary and not sufficient, which severity_accuracy shows
// from both ends. mast's extractor reads all 31 expected responses where
// upstream's reads none, so the metric has reached the whole corpus
// since v0.3 — and it was still wrong in two ways this guard cannot see.
// It silently failed to read a decorated verdict on the *actual* side
// (7 of 31 rows of one 2026-08-19 board, 0 of 31 of another, so the
// published gap between two model families was partly markdown style;
// fixed in extractSeverity), and the corpus states no severity
// definition for the buckets 20 of its 31 rows are labelled with, so the
// score it produces cannot be acted on however completely it reaches
// (#179, which demoted it to diagnostic). A metric that scores every row
// has cleared this bar and no other.
//
// tool_coverage is the same lesson from the other side: this table
// reported it 31/31 scorable while it returned 0.000 on every row of
// every board, because reach asked whether a scenario had *declared* an
// expectation rather than whether the expectation could be *met*. A
// guard that measures the wrong property is the defect it exists to
// catch, so it caught nothing about itself. Fixed in ToolCoverage (#174)
// rather than here, because vacuity is the evaluator's judgement and
// this table only counts it.

// CorpusReach measures the corpus-side metrics against the loaded
// dataset and intent table.
//
// The three metrics here are the ones whose vacuity is a property of the
// *expectation* rather than of any run: a scenario that declares no
// expected tools gives intent_coverage nothing to score no matter what
// the agent does, and one whose expected response carries no severity
// token gives severity_accuracy nothing to compare. That is why the
// probe passes an empty Trace — it isolates the corpus half, and it uses
// the real evaluators so the guard follows any change to what vacuity
// means. TestCorpusReach_IsTraceIndependent pins the property the probe
// relies on.
//
// Since #174 the expectation is read against the intent table's tool
// catalog as well as against the scenario, which is why the table is a
// parameter rather than only intent_coverage's business. That is still a
// fact about the corpus and not about the run: which names exist is
// fixed before any agent starts, so the empty-trace probe holds.
//
// effect_ordering and exactly_once are deliberately absent: their
// vacuity is a property of the run (no mutating effects to order), not
// of the corpus, so there is nothing here for them to be measured
// against. The differentiator tier is what proves those two are not
// constants — E-exactly-once asserts both score 1.00 on a run that
// actually mutates, and would catch an evaluator that had degenerated
// into returning a fixed value.
