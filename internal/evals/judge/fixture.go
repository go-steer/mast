// Package judge is the metered tier of the v0.3 parity eval suite
// (docs/v0.3-plan.md W0.5): the 31-scenario corpus scored against a real
// model, which is the only tier that produces a LangChain-comparable
// number.
//
// # Why this tier needs a fixture cluster at all
//
// The corpus's expected responses assert facts that are not in the
// prompt. LC-01's scenario says only that a container "exits with code 1
// within seconds of starting"; its expected response names the log line
// `Error: DATABASE_URL not set` and the Secret `api-server-secrets`.
// Those are only reachable by calling a tool. Upstream's judge prompt
// puts the expected response in as ground truth and defines
// correct_diagnosis as matching it, so an agent with no cluster to read
// cannot score above the floor no matter how well it reasons — the
// metric would measure fixture starvation. The fixture therefore serves
// observations the agent can read.
//
// # The rule that keeps the measurement honest
//
// A fixture authored freely from the expected response would hand the
// model its own answer, and the judge would be grading transcription.
// So exactly one mechanical rule governs what may cross from the answer
// side into the cluster:
//
//	Only quoted spans of the expected response become observations.
//
// Unquoted prose never crosses. That is what makes the boundary
// checkable rather than a matter of authorial restraint: the diagnosis
// in LC-01 ("the pod references a secret key that does not exist"), the
// severity, and the remediation are all unquoted, so none of them can
// reach the agent. The raw artifacts they were inferred *from* — the log
// line, the Secret's name — are quoted, so they can. The agent still has
// to do the inference and grade the severity itself, which is the work
// being measured.
//
// [Guard] enforces the rule against both derived and hand-written
// observations, and TestGuard_RejectsConclusions pins it.
//
// # What this measures, and what it does not
//
// It measures: given faithful cluster data, does the agent read the
// right things, reach the right diagnosis, grade severity correctly, and
// write something an operator could act on. It does *not* measure
// whether mast's real lookout read path surfaces those facts — that is
// lookout's own CI (scoreboard lead row L6). A green judge board with a
// broken read path is possible and would not be caught here.
