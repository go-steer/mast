// TestJudgeSkipsThinking pins that the grader's reply is read from its answer
// and not from its thinking block (#370).
//
// Grade concatenates every part into one buffer and then scans that buffer for
// the grade object, so a thinking block does not merely ride along here — it is
// parser input. jsonObjects already documents what a stray brace does to the
// scan, and reasoning is where a grader restates the rubric, so the brace it
// takes is the likely one rather than a contrived one. The failure is silent in
// the worst way: a grader error is reported as a missing column, so the board
// comes back short rather than red, and the judged tier quietly stops measuring
// the rows it could not parse.
//
// The thought here carries a single unbalanced `{`. Broken, the scan never
// returns to depth zero, finds no candidate at all, and Grade fails with
// "grader returned no JSON object".
//
// Neutralize check: restore `p.Text != ""` in Grade's part loop and this
// returns that error instead of the scripted 4.
