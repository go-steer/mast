// Cluster is the fixture cluster behind one scenario's run: which
// lookout tool returns what.
//
// # Which tools answer
//
// A tool answers when the intents it satisfies overlap the intents the
// scenario expects. Everything else returns an honest empty reading,
// which is what a real cluster does — querying storage during a DNS
// incident finds nothing wrong with storage.
//
// That makes tool choice the thing under measurement, which is what
// intent_coverage scores. It also has a limitation worth stating
// plainly: a *different but legitimate* read path returns empty and
// looks to the agent like a dead end, because the corpus's
// expected_tools list is the only evidence anything has about what this
// cluster contains. The judge tier inherits that ceiling from the
// corpus; it is the same assumption upstream's own tool_coverage makes,
// and it is why intent_coverage — which at least credits consolidation
// — is the primary metric rather than tool_coverage.
//
// # What an answering tool returns
//
// Its natural half of the fixture: log and event tools return
// [Observations.Messages], spec and topology tools return
// [Observations.Fields], and the three consolidators return both. A
// scenario whose observations cannot reach the agent through any
// answering tool is a build error, not a low score — see
// [NewCluster].

// The three consolidators return both halves; the rest are single-sided
// because a log tool that also returned specs would make tool choice
// cosmetic.
//
// Names and coverage come from testdata/evals/intents.yaml's
// lookout_tools block, which is checked against k8s-lookout's MCPName
// registry. [NewCluster] fails on any drift between the two.
