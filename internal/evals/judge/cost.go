// J-cost-tier: does a tiered roster's cheap analyst actually get billed
// at the cheap rate?
//
// This measurement cannot be made anywhere but here, and that is the
// whole reason it exists as a judge-tier check rather than a Go test.
// W1.2 finding (b): an offline-fake root collapses every `model:` and
// `tier:` back to itself, so under `echo` the tiers this asks about do
// not exist — the E tier can assert the wiring and never the price. Unit
// tests cover the arithmetic (TestMeterScopes_OverridePricesAtItsOwnTier,
// TestMeterScopes_TierPricesAtItsResolvedModel); what neither can cover
// is a real provider answering with real usage numbers on a roster whose
// two halves ran on two different models.
//
// So: one incident, two specialists, two tiers, live. Then read the
// meter's per-scope snapshot and ask whether the analyst's dollars are
// its own.
