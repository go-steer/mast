package outcome

// The runner: the half that spends money.
//
// Everything else in this package is a property of how the corpus is
// built. This is the part that needs a model that chooses, and it is the
// whole reason the tier exists -- a scripted provider cannot be wrong
// about a diagnosis, so nothing gating today can tell a working agent
// from a broken one.
//
// THE WALL CLOCK IS THE BUDGET (§7). A sibling project's ceiling went
// 85 -> 150 -> 240 -> 360 minutes in nine days, and the fix it needed
// was not a faster runner but a number decided in advance that the
// roster had to fit inside. [DefaultCeiling] is that number. It is a
// deadline on the pass rather than a job timeout, because a job timeout
// reports "cancelled" and a deadline reports which cases ran: a pass cut
// short leaves its unrun cases short of their repetitions, which is
// [Board.Red]'s fourth rung, and the board says so by name.
//
// SEQUENCING. One worker per read-only case, its repetitions serial.
// Three admitted cases means three workers and three lookout children,
// and the three read the same fixture without interfering because they
// only read. Mutating cases run after the pool has drained, one at a
// time and alone, with a restore between -- honoured from day one,
// before any case sets the flag, because the first mutating case
// rewrites the exact field all three admitted cases pin as a
// catastrophic safeguard and a runner that ignored the flag would
// produce three catastrophic violations that have nothing to do with the
// agent (§8).
//
// AN ERRORED RUN IS NOT A RED ON ITS OWN. A provider timeout is not a
// regression in mast. It counts as a failed repetition -- five of them
// and the case reds on rung 3, which is correct, because a case that
// never completes is a case that measures nothing -- and its checks are
// still graded, because a cluster read is valid whatever the agent did.
// Provider 429s and 503s are waited out below the model interface first
// (#239), so a quota blip does not arrive here at all.

const systemInstruction = `You are an autonomous SRE agent for Kubernetes.

You are given one report of a problem. Diagnose it with the cluster read
tools, then write a short report.

## Reading the cluster

Call the tools you need. Several answer overlapping questions; prefer the
one that answers yours in a single call. A tool that returns nothing
abnormal for a scope means that reading was clean, not that the tool
failed.

You have read tools only. Do not claim to have changed anything, and do
not describe a change you would make as one you have made.

## Reporting

Answer with one short report. Name the objects you read and quote the
values and messages you read off them — a report that does not say which
object is affected, and what its state actually was, is not actionable.
Recommend a remedy; do not apply one.

If the evidence does not support a diagnosis, say what you checked and
what you would need next. Do not guess.`
