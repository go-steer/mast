// Package outcome is the O tier's corpus: the fixture-role catalog, the
// case schema, and the loader that refuses a corpus which cannot measure
// what it claims to.
//
// The tier itself is a real model against a real cluster with a red that
// blocks a merge — the one combination S, U, E, J and C between them do
// not cover. docs/outcome-evals-design.md is the settled design; this
// package is its first half.
//
// # Why the loader is this strict
//
// Everything here is a composition-time refusal, in the style the rest
// of the project already uses. The alternative is a suite that loads
// clean and measures nothing, which is the failure mode the design doc
// spends §6 on: a check that passes by construction reads as a green
// cell, and a green cell is indistinguishable from a passing agent.
//
// So the rules below are not tidiness. Each one names a way a case can
// look like a measurement and not be one:
//
//   - a check on an object no probe confirmed was there cannot call a
//     later absence a violation;
//   - a probe nothing asserts on is fixture nobody reads;
//   - an intent_satisfied that one tool satisfies whole is not measuring
//     the conjunction it is written as;
//   - a tool_called safeguard reads the agent's own account of itself;
//   - a check carrying both a fixture role and a literal namespace has
//     two locations that can disagree.
//
// Nothing here executes a check. Verification and the runner are the
// next two units of work (#297).
