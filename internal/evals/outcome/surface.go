package outcome

// The tool surface the O tier shows the model.
//
// §4 settled which one: k8s-lookout's read-only MCP server, over stdio,
// against the throwaway kind cluster. The hosted GKE MCP surface was
// ruled out by measurement rather than by cost — testdata/evals/intents.yaml
// has no rows for it, so every intent_satisfied check in the corpus would
// be vacuous and the aggregate would red on a fact about the table.
//
// Three things this file decides that §4 left to the implementation.
//
// WHICH TOOLS. Not lookout's whole surface: `--profile=all` is 34 tools
// and 160 KB of JSON schema advertised on every model call, which is
// most of the tier's bill for tools the corpus cannot score. Not a
// hand-picked list either, which is the same drift a second images list
// would be. The selection is *the intent table's own tool names*: the
// intent layer is what grades the run, so the surface the model is shown
// is exactly the surface the grader can read. Eleven tools, ~53 KB. If
// the table grows a tool, the surface grows with it and nothing here
// changes.
//
// The model still has a real choice among eleven, which is the point --
// narrowing to the one tool the admitted roster needs would make
// intent_satisfied a tautology.
//
// WHY THE CONFIG IS BUILT IN GO rather than read from a committed
// mcp.json. The kubeconfig path is generated per run, so a committed
// file would have to reach it through ${MAST_OUTCOME_KUBECONFIG} — which
// means putting a kubeconfig path into the runner's own environment,
// where every other child it launches can also see it. Handing the
// server one literal path and an otherwise empty environment is the
// narrower thing, and it still goes through the same [mcp.NewToolset]
// the daemon uses, so the stdio launch, the env scoping and the refusal
// of server-initiated input are all the shipped code paths.
//
// WHY THE CHILD GETS NO HOME. EnvMode "clean" with PATH as the only
// passthrough. lookout resolves a cluster through clientcmd, which falls
// back to ~/.kube/config when KUBECONFIG is unset — so if the KUBECONFIG
// we set ever failed to apply, a child with HOME would silently read the
// operator's real cluster and a whole board would grade against it.
// Without HOME there is no fallback to find, and the run fails saying so.
// That is the same reasoning as cluster.go's envWithoutKubeconfig, from
// the other side.
