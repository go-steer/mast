// TestTraceFinalTextSkipsThinking pins that a run's FinalText is what the run
// said, not what it thought (#370).
//
// FinalText is what the severity evaluator reads and what a failing row prints,
// so a leak here does two things at once: it scores the model on reasoning it
// was never asked to publish — reasoning that habitually contains the words the
// severity rubric matches on, because that is where the model weighs them — and
// it copies the thinking block into the board's own output.
//
// The parts are ordered answer-then-reasoning because this site keeps the LAST
// model text part; under the other order it is correct by accident. See the
// note in cmd/mast/thoughtfilter_test.go on why mast does not get to assume an
// order.
//
// Neutralize check: restore `part.Text != ""` in TraceFromEvents and FinalText
// is the reasoning.
