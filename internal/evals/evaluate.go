// comparison number. Name-level set overlap scores a better-factored
// read path as a regression: LC-22 names three upstream tools that one
// k8s_triage_workload call answers completely, and this metric scores
// that 0/3. Keeping it visible keeps the consolidation penalty legible
// instead of scored.
//
// # Vacuity is satisfiability, not declaration (#174)
//
// A scenario reaches this metric only when at least one name it expects
// is a name the runtime can emit. That is a stronger test than "the
// scenario declared something", and the difference is the whole corpus:
// the ported dataset names upstream's kubectl_* surface, mast's is
// k8s_*, and the intersection is empty on all 31 rows. Under the
// declaration-shaped test every row reached, so CorpusReach reported
// 31/31 scorable for a metric that is 0.000 by construction — the guard
// against a constant function calling a constant function healthy.
//
// The neighbouring intent_coverage never had this problem, because it
// builds its denominator after mapping names through the intent table.
// Two definitions of reach sat side by side in one file and only the
// declaration-shaped one was wrong; that asymmetry was the bug, rather
// than any single line.
//
// Note what does not change: the score. An unsatisfiable expectation
// still reports 0/N and still names the tools, because the consolidation
// penalty is the reason this metric exists. What changes is that the
// harness stops averaging that 0 into a board, and says out loud that

// SeverityAccuracy is an exact match on the severity the run declared
// against the severity the scenario expects.
//
// The extractor is deliberately not upstream's. Upstream matches
// \[(CRITICAL|WARNING|INFO|OK)\] — bracketed — against data that writes
// a bare "CRITICAL: " prefix, so it scores 0 on all 31 rows regardless
// of what any agent does. Here the expected side is read the way the
// corpus is actually written, and the actual side accepts the formats a
// model plausibly emits for the same claim.
//
// # Why this is diagnostic and not a comparison number (#179)
//
// Every board since v0.3 has read near half here, with the misses almost
// all one direction — expected WARNING, got CRITICAL — on two unrelated
// model families. Two readings fit that equally well: the corpus labels
// contradict the severity definitions the corpus itself ships, or mast's
// rubric escalates past them. #179 asked for the misses to be
// partitioned between the two, against the corpus's own stated
// definitions rather than its labels.
//
// That partition is not derivable from this corpus. The definitions are
// twelve enumerated conditions (judge.systemInstruction, taken verbatim
// from upstream): CRITICAL is "service down, crash loops, OOM kills, 0
// ready endpoints", WARNING is "no PDB, missing probes, :latest images,
// wildcard RBAC", INFO is "right-sizing, orphaned PVs, suspended
// CronJobs". Over the 31 scenarios, the CRITICAL conditions occur in 5;
// the WARNING and INFO conditions occur in none at all. Twenty of the 31
// rows are nonetheless labelled WARNING or INFO — buckets the rubric
// describes with four hygiene examples the corpus never once presents.
// judge.TestSeverityRubricDoesNotSpanCorpus pins that measurement.
//
// So on almost every row that misses, there is no stated definition to
// partition against, and the two readings are indistinguishable in
// principle rather than merely by this metric. Where the rubric does
// decide a row it contradicts the label twice in five — LC-03 is an
// OOMKill labelled WARNING, LC-10 has 0 endpoints and is labelled
// WARNING — and both families miss both rows by answering what they were
// told to answer.
//
// Tuning the rubric until the number moves was rejected in v0.3 as
// teaching to the test, and that still holds: there is nothing here to
// tune against. The number is reported, and the per-row comment stays
// legible, but it is not a claim about mast — the same disposition
// tool_coverage has, for a sibling reason. Re-promoting it needs a
// corpus that states a basis for the buckets it labels with.
