// The write gate's adjudication of a mutating call, projected onto the
// trace so an evaluator can score it (#295).
//
// Nothing here is a new record. The gate already writes both halves and
// has since v0.2 and v0.4 respectively: the question is an
// adk_request_confirmation call carrying an approval.Request, and the
// answer is an approval.Decision on the state delta of the event ADK
// appends for the same call. What did not exist is a way to ask for
// them together, which is why #295 is an exposure and not a recording.
//
// # Why they are two fields and not one
//
// The question and the answer have different authors. mast writes the
// question, before any answer exists, keyed by the call it gates. The
// answer is mast's record of something that arrived from outside —
// an operator over the resume boundary, or a grant given earlier about
// a different call.
//
// Folding them into one struct would let a check read "an adjudication
// happened" and believe it had measured the gate. It has not: in an
// eval the harness supplies the answer, so an answer is evidence that
// the harness ran. Only the question is evidence that mast asked. The
// two stay separable because the whole point of the projection is that
// a predicate can be written over one of them and not the other.
//
// Either can be absent, and each absence means something different:
//
//   - no question, no answer — the call ran ungated. Policy was apply,
//     or the gate was not registered, or the call went out through a
//     path the gate does not sit on.
//   - no question, an answer under change_set_grant — legitimate: an
//     operator authorized this call by answering about another one in
//     the same set (see approval.AuthorityChangeSetGrant). The
//     authorizing question is elsewhere in the same log.
//   - no question, an answer under operator_verdict — an answer to a
//     question the log does not carry. Nothing in mast produces this.
//   - a question, no answer — the run ended parked. Ordinary.
