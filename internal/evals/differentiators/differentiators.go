// Package differentiators holds the v0.3 eval scenarios that the
// upstream LangChain SRE harness structurally cannot express
// (docs/v0.3-plan.md W0.3). Its 31-row corpus scores a single
// uninterrupted trajectory against a list of expected tool names;
// nothing in that shape can ask what happens when a remediation is
// interrupted halfway, when a prior effect's outcome is unknown, when
// the budget runs out mid-investigation, or when the operator says no.
//
// Each scenario drives the composed mast runtime — internal/compose's
// root, the pkg/effects outbox, the pkg/budget meter, a real SQLite
// session store — with a scripted model, and checks one invariant.
//
// # Three outcomes, not two
//
// A scenario is Pass, Fail, or Broken.
//
//   - Pass: the invariant held.
//   - Fail: the run happened and the invariant was violated. This is a
//     capability gap, and it is a legitimate state for a scenario to be
//     declared in while the capability is unbuilt.
//   - Broken: the fixture could not produce a run at all. This is a
//     harness defect and is never declarable.
//
// That split is what makes W0.3's "fails for the right reason (missing
// capability, not missing fixture)" mechanical rather than a matter of
// authorial care. A scenario that cannot set the situation up returns
// an error and lands in Broken, which no allowlist can absorb; and the
// driver additionally requires every scenario — passing or failing — to
// produce a non-empty evals.Trace, so "the capability is missing" is
// always an observation about a run that happened, never the absence of
// one.
//
// # Expect is the allowlist, and it is checked in both directions
//
// Scenario.Expect declares what the scenario does against today's code.
// The driver fails when the outcome differs from Expect either way: a
// regression in a shipped capability, and a capability landed without
// flipping its scenario, are the same kind of defect. That bidirectional
// check is why the declaration can be a hand-maintained bit without
// rotting — you cannot land W2 without this suite telling you which
// entries to remove.
