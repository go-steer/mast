"""Verify every root-relative internal link in the built site resolves.

Walks `docs/site/dist/**/*.html`, extracts every href/src whose URL
starts with the deploy base (default `/mast/`), and confirms the
target exists on disk. This is the offline equivalent of running the
site behind a real server and following every link.

Ported from go-steer/core-agent's script of the same name. Note the
scope: a green `astro build` does NOT imply working links — Starlight
core has no link validation, and un-prefixed root-relative links
(missing the deploy base) or typo'd targets both survive the build.

Excluded:
  - External URLs (any scheme://)
  - Anchors (#foo)
  - mailto:/tel: etc.
  - URLs pointing outside the deploy base
  - Query strings (asset caching); the path portion is checked

Exits non-zero on any dead link.
